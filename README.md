# Shipment Delay Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## 📦 Project Overview
This project analyzes shipment delays affecting import customers (consignees) in a logistics environment.  
The goal is to identify operational bottlenecks, understand root causes of delays, and provide actionable insights using data.

Using a simulated dataset of 1,500+ shipment records, I performed data analysis using SQL and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators such as on-time delivery, average delay, carrier performance, and delay reasons.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Import customers were experiencing frequent shipment delays, impacting customer satisfaction and service reliability.  
The business needed clarity on:
- How often delays occur  
- Which customers are most impacted  
- Which carriers are underperforming  
- What the main root causes of delays are  
- How performance trends change over time

## 💡 Key Insights
- Port congestion emerged as the most common cause of delays  
- Certain carriers consistently showed higher average delays  
- A small number of customers were disproportionately impacted by delays  
- High-priority shipments showed better on-time performance  
- Seasonal spikes in delays were visible in specific months
